# Game "Find the treasure"

## Description

The goal of the game is to find the hidden treasure on the field.

You can search for it by clicking on the game field. You can make an assumption about the location of the treasure from the hint under the playing field. The number of clicks (attempts) is limited and is displayed under the playing field.

You **won** if a yellow circle appeared on the playing field (this is the place where the treasure was hidden).

You **lose** if the number of attempts is over and the treasure is not found.
